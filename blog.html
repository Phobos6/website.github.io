        <div class="text">
        <p>
            I have always dreamed of going into the aerospace sector and during high school I had the opportunity to go after that goal. I took Aviation Tech during my sophomore year which was just FAA ground school. This class prepared me to take the FAA Write Pilot’s Exam, an exam that you have to take if you want to become a private pilot. With this  exam under my belt it would allow me to become a private pilot if I wanted to. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently I want to become an aerospace engineer and taking Aviation Tech allowed me to get a different perspective on aircraft. It shows me what characteristics of aircraft are the most important. The class would also help me become an aerospace engineer as I would know what I am talking about when it came to how aircraft feel when in flight.
        </p>
        <p>
            The class was a great experience and allowed me to talk to knowledge people about aircraft. The class also allowed me to interact without people that share a passion of aircraft and how they work. If I didn’t take the class I be lost when it came to breaking into the aerospace sector.

        <div class="heading"><h1>Sailing</h1></div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Ever since I was a small child I have loved sailing and the freeing experience of it. I grew up learning how to sail on a 30 foot Beneteau with my dad and his sailing partners. Sailing is a great skill to learn as it not only teaches you how to sail but teaches you leadership and how to work well and efficiently with others. Sailing for days on end is such a freeing experience as you don’t have to worry about anything else except for the wind and yourself.</p>
            <p>I have also learned how to sail Sunfish, Flying Scots, and Hobbie Cats and are licensed in all three craft. I have also raced Flying Juniors in regattas, regattas are fun while also taking a toll on everyone involved. You have to maximize the performance of your boat while making sure you don’t break any rules or crash into another team. Teaching kids how to sail is a rewarding experience as they are very eager to learn.</p>
            <p>Sailing for days on end is an odd experience as you can continue on one heading for hours on end before you have to change course. There is a lot of down time when cruising allowing you to read talk with others. Sailing in a large body of water is much different than sailing in a river because there is virtually no traffic and you don’t have to make as many course corrections compared to when you are sailing in a river. Sailing has shaped and molded me into who I am today and how I go about doing tasks.</p>
